        <h1>Recent Projects</h1>
        <p>In the past few years I have been active in the following:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Restructuring and confirmation assessments of the engineering configuration management system at the Hanford Site River Corridor Cleanup project. This activity was necessitated by an issue identified by DOE RL, and required rewriting or revising most of the engineering procedure set. I subsequently trained more than 200 personnel on the system and performed assessments to verify implementation of the revised processes. I performed this work for Washington Closure Hanford as an employee of CH2M Hill, Inc.</li>
          <li>Development and auditing of the US DOE Office of River Protection (Hanford Site) QA program and procedures.  This work was prompted when the DOE ORP recognized the need for a complete re-write of their QA program to bring it into conformance with NQA-1, "Quality Assurance Requirements for Nuclear Facility Applications."  I performed this work as an employee of Project Assistance Corp. and as a "1099 employee" of Longenecker and Associates.  The customer was ORP.</li>
          <li>QA assessments of the Hanford Site Waste Treatment and Vitrification Plant construction project.  These included assessments of computer software quality, QA program, engineering, procurement, and construction.  The WTP is the biggest project within the Department of Energy.  I performed this work as an employee of Project Assistance Corp. and as a "1099 employee" of Longenecker and Associates.  The customer was ORP.</li>
          <li>Assessment of the Idaho Cleanup Project (ICP) computer software for the Integrated Waste Treatment Unit construction project.  The assessment addressed software development, maitnenance, and use.  The ICP requested my help at a critical time in the life of the project, anticipating the approaching operational readiness review.  I performed this work as a "1099 employee" of North Wind, Inc.  The customer was the ICP.</li>
          <li>Assessments and QA surveillances of the Hanford Tank Farms.  Oversight addressed computer software, development of the Tank Farms QA program, and other quality-related activities.   I performed this work as an employee of Project Assistance Corp. and as a "1099 employee" of Longenecker and Associates.  The customer was ORP.</li>
